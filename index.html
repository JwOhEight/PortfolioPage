                    <p>
                    Thanks to the the youth of my parents and the rise of smart technology in the mid to late 2000's and , I was introduced to gaming and its related technology at the perfect time. Every since I was able to use a Ninendo 64 controller, I was hooked. I had used our family's first computer, learned to game, use dial-up, and eventually learn to use broadband internet by myself.<br>
                    Once I got my first laptop at 15, I started experimenting with music on FL Studio. At this point in my life, I had finally come to learn what it meant to be creative and use a technology to express myself through a creative medium. I see this as the turning point for me that would end up as the basis for my choices in careers in my adult life.<br>
                    Now at 22, I'm taking a turn and delving into coding, seeking to make it a full-time job. My goal is to use coding as a medium for creative expression, eventually getting me into web and game development.</p>
