                    <h2>I'm Jacob "Jw" Gebel.</h2>
                    <p>I'm a 22 year old front-end developer with a life-long passion for computers and deconstructing hardware. In January of 2024, I decided to officially begin my treck down the endless creative road that is coding. <br>
                    Thanks to my young parent, I've been playing video games since the moment I was able to use a <a class="hyperlink">Nintendo 64 controller</a>, and I don't think I'll ever stop.<br>
                    Once I got my first laptop at 15, I started experimenting with music on FL Studio. At this point in my life, I had finally come to learn what it meant to be creative and use a technology to express myself through a creative medium. I see this as the turning point for me that would end up as the basis for my choices in careers in my adult life.</p>
